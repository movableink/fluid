# Design System Glossary

These terms are commonly used when talking about Design Systems. Some of these terms have many definitions that change with context. Our goal is to help provide a shared understanding of what we mean when we use these words in our work.

#### Design System

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Design systems are made up of documented patterns, visual properties, code snippets, and usage guidelines.

#### Pattern Library

A subclass in the design system, this is the set of design patterns for use across a company.

#### Style Guide

Another subclass in the design system, this static documentation describes the design system itself: how products should look and feel, use cases for UI patterns, correct typographic scales, etc.

#### Component

Interface element that can be reused across the Movable Ink system. Our components typically support both Ember.js and raw HTML/CSS. Components should be well documented, supported and tested across all modern browsers and be accessible to all.

#### Element

Typically used to describe an HTML element. In our context, elements are the smallest base object in a document.

#### Pattern

A formal way of documenting a general reusable solution to a design problem in the Movable Ink Platform.

#### Design Tokens

Anything we see on a website is built from elements of style: elements like color, spacing, typography, line height, and opacity. The CSS rules associated with these elements can accept a broad continuum of values — in the case of color, there are over 16 million separate colors in the RGB color space. Font size, line height, spacing, and others can accept a similarly wide range of values.
This degree of choice can slow down design work and make communication between designer and developer unnecessarily granular. USWDS seeks to maximize design efficiency and improve communication with design tokens: the discrete palettes of values from which we base all our visual design.
Design tokens are a limited set of discrete options, just like a scale of musical notes is drawn from the spectrum of all possible frequencies. Or like the presets on a car radio — not every option, just a specific selection. - US Web Design Standards.
You can think of a design token as a key that unlocks a specific value

#### Utilities

Utilities are simple HTML classes typically scoped to a single CSS property like background-color. Utilities can be used additively to style an object from scratch or to override a style defined in component CSS.

#### Grid

A framework made up of evenly divided, intersecting columns and rows. Grids help designers to align and arrange elements in a quicker, neater, and more consistent way.
Scale
The change of size of an object while keeping its shape and proportions intact. Large scale can create drama, and smaller scale can create fine detail.

#### Whitespace

Also called ‘negative space’, white space refers to the areas of a design that are not filled with content. White space is an important design element as it helps to let a design ‘breathe’, helps avoid overly complicated designs, and keeps designs looking clean.

#### Brand

A collection of concepts, ideas, and emotions that encapsulate your company’s values and ethos. A brand is a mix of all the fine conceptual details that make up the company, from the content the brand promotes, the way employees talk, the words used, the values upheld, etc.

#### Brandmark

A type of logo design where a symbol is used in place of the company name, i.e. the Apple logo. Brandmarks are commonly accompanied by a logotype, but not always.

#### Brand Identity

The visualization of your brand (see definition above) in a way that represents the values, content and ethos of the company. This can include things like a logo, business cards, letterheads, uniforms, packaging design, etc.

#### Logotype

A type of logo where the name of the company designed in a visual way. Think of brands like Google, Ikea, Disney.
Bug
A software bug is a problem causing a program to crash or produce an invalid output. Most bugs are due to human error.

#### Chore

An Item that provides value to the Team or Product, as opposed to an external Stakeholder; an Item whose value is other than Business Value.

#### Feature

A Feature is a service that fulfills a stakeholder need. Each feature includes a benefit hypothesis and acceptance criteria, and is sized or split as necessary to be delivered by a single team.

#### Debt (Design or Tech)

You have two ways of doing something. One will be quick, but come with trade offs. The second will take longer, but not add any debt. Debt is the extra time it will take to do the better option, having done the messy option.

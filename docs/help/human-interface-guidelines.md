# Vision

The objective of the Human Interface Guidelines is to help developers and designers create apps that are highly valued by users of the Movable Ink platform, make it easier for them to create those apps, and to define and generate a standardization of the elements that make up all apps. With our MVP we hope to clearly communicate those standards along with, informing those reading it: how to use the guidelines and the benefits of using the recommendations listed.

The format will consist of a google document, but future iterations can expand into Github as we intend that the guidelines be a “living” document to be shared, updated and contributed to by any interested party and should therefore be placed where it is most accessible. We will be writing this documentation with those who are our intended users: members of the Solutions Engineering team, the Product Engineering team, the Partners team, and the Design Team as the guidelines are meant to be a helpful tool – not a mandate handed down – an opportunity for collaboration across our teams.

Once the guidelines are in a state of review and refinement, we’ll shift our focus to creating a plan for training and maintenance of the guidelines. We’ll be measuring adoption of the guidelines and making adjustments where needed to ensure its success. Expected outcomes if the guidelines are fully adopted and regularly referenced: the apps created internally and by agencies and third parties are positively impacting the users of those apps and meet a high standard of functionality and user experience.
